# ======================================================================
# There are 5 questions in this exam with increasing difficulty from 1-5.
# Please note that the weight of the grade for the question is relative
# to its difficulty. So your Category 1 question will score significantly
# less than your Category 5 question.
#
# Don't use lambda layers in your model.
# You do not need them to solve the question.
# Lambda layers are not supported by the grading infrastructure.
#
# You must use the Submit and Test button to submit your model
# at least once in this category before you finally submit your exam,
# otherwise you will score zero for this category.

#
# Basic Datasets Question
#
# Create a classifier for the Fashion MNIST dataset
# Note that the test will expect it to classify 10 classes and that the
# input shape should be the native size of the Fashion MNIST dataset which is
# 28x28 monochrome. Do not resize the data. Your input layer should accept
# (28,28) as the input shape only. If you amend this, the tests will fail.
#

def solution_model():
    fashion_mnist = tf.keras.datasets.fashion_mnist

    # YOUR CODE HERE
    return model


# Note that you'll need to save your model as a .h5 like this.
# When you press the Submit and Test button, your saved .h5 model will
# be sent to the testing infrastructure for scoring
# and the score will be returned to you.
