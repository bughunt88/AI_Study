# ======================================================================
# There are 5 questions in this exam with increasing difficulty from 1-5.
# Please note that the weight of the grade for the question is relative
# to its difficulty. So your Category 1 question will score significantly
# less than your Category 5 question.
#
# Don't use lambda layers in your model.
# You do not need them to solve the question.
# Lambda layers are not supported by the grading infrastructure.
#
# You must use the Submit and Test button to submit your model
# at least once in this category before you finally submit your exam,
# otherwise you will score zero for this category.

#
# Computer vision with CNNs
#
# Create and train a classifier for horses or humans using the provided data.
# Make sure your final layer is a 1 neuron, activated by sigmoid as shown.
#
# The test will use images that are 300x300 with 3 bytes color depth so be sure to
# design your neural network accordingly
