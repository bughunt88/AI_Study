# ======================================================================
# There are 5 questions in this exam with increasing difficulty from 1-5.
# Please note that the weight of the grade for the question is relative
# to its difficulty. So your Category 1 question will score significantly
# less than your Category 5 question.
#
# Don't use lambda layers in your model.
# You do not need them to solve the question.
# Lambda layers are not supported by the grading infrastructure.
#
# You must use the Submit and Test button to submit your model
# at least once in this category before you finally submit your exam,
# otherwise you will score zero for this category.

# Computer Vision with CNNs

# Build a classifier for Rock-Paper-Scissors based on the rock_paper_scissors
# TensorFlow dataset.
#
# IMPORTANT: Your final layer should be as shown. Do not change the
# provided code, or the tests may fail
#
# IMPORTANT: Images will be tested as 150x150 with 3 bytes of color depth
# So ensure that your input layer is designed accordingly, or the tests
# may fail. 
#
# NOTE THAT THIS IS UNLABELLED DATA. 
# You can use the ImageDataGenerator to automatically label it
# and we have provided some starter code.
